# rusty-chords

`rusty-chords` helps you name chords!

I'm working on getting the following basic functionalities down:

- name a chord, given some notes
- let it work with JSON using `serde`
- build a minimal backend API (with rust ofc)
- build a frontend (graphic design is my passion /s)

This project is starting off as a write of [`what-chord`](https://github.com/adamkadda/what-chord), but I think it'll be more than that.
